##THE Joe_ldraws site

#what is it
This is a site i have decided to make for my friend to show case some of his art though also just added in some filler pics of my cat and a random guy.

#why?
I made it cause once I told him as I learn web development, I would like to be the guy to make his sites in the future.And as time goes and I get better at web development this site will be in my top tier lists of projects I would personally work on to develope my skills.
